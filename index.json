I like comfort and efficiency. If I know the temperature of each room in my house, with periodic measurements twenty four hours a day, I can tune the heating system to be comfortable and energy efficient. Because I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a geek, this is classed as \u0026lsquo;fun\u0026rsquo; which means I don\u0026rsquo;t need to offset the cost of the project against my heating bill.\nWhat? I want a way to have a log of the temperature in each room of my house at regular intervals without having to be there in person, or - for that matter - be awake.\nHow? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s the question, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? My starting assumption is that I need a sensor in every room. This rules out a single smart thermostat which might learn my habits, but would be woefully under-informed about the temperatures across my house.\nContents:\n Priorities Purchases microSD OS image #First boot Configure with Ansible  Priorities I\u0026rsquo;ve had lots of recommendations for good approaches. There are trade-offs to be made for each:\n Battery vs mains Portability Low maintenance  Some applications need the freedom to put the sensors anywhere. My preference is to have a system that I maintain (in person) about once a year. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to give up a power socket per room to get that, and have the sensor within reach of that power socket.\n Wifi vs bluetooth vs Z-Wave vs Zigbee vs ethernet Dedicated device vs DIY mashup Arduino vs Raspberry Pi Affinity to my skills  I\u0026rsquo;ve done my time writing assembler and embedded C (for now, at least). I learnt both at university, and applied those skills in my first job after my degree. I\u0026rsquo;ve helped write I2C libraries and (different job) an X10 module in Python. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve got the aptitude to use any of those options. ￼But do I want to?\n Alignment to my areas of interest  I\u0026rsquo;m working in the wonderful world of DevOps, where Python and Ansible and Prometheus are regularly in the spotlight. I\u0026rsquo;m a manager in my day-job, so I don\u0026rsquo;t actually get to play with the toys (except spreadsheets). It\u0026rsquo;d be cool to have a solution that uses those.\n Price per unit: Cheaper is better, as long as the fun-factor is maintained. Development time: Quicker is better. There aren\u0026rsquo;t many fun-project-hours in a given month. Availability of equipment: If it needs a lathe, a 3D printer or an underground network of tunnels, it\u0026rsquo;s out.  Arduino approach    Cost Thing     £20 Arduino uno / £6 Arduino nano   £5 Real time clock board/Data logging shield   £6 Temperature sensor   £8 Bluetooth module??    Total: £39 per unit. I reckon that component list wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work - the nano and uno have different form factors, the bluetooth has to talk to \u0026hellip; something, but it gives me a place to start. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard I get a WiFi-enabled-Arduino-compatible board from China for cheaps. So that\u0026rsquo;s an option.\nRaspberry Pi approach    Cost Thing     £10 Raspberry Pi Zero W   £4 DS18B20 temperature sensor   £0 4.7kohm resistor - free with sensor   £1 40 pin header   £6 USB PSU   £3 Case   £3 Shipping    Total: £27 per unit\nBlocker: I can order only one Raspberry Pi Zero W per customer? What madness is this?\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to give the Raspberry Pi route a try. It hits a lot of the sweet spots, and it\u0026rsquo;ll be fun - even if I can\u0026rsquo;t source 10 RPi Zero Ws because of the bizarre sales limits.\nPurchases Here\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m starting out with.\nCentral control server:\n Raspberry Pi 4 microSD card Case Pi 4 official power supply  Temperature sensor pi:\n Waterproof DS18B20 Digital temperature sensor + extras Raspberry Pi Zero W microSD card Case Micro-USB power supply  microSD OS image The first order of business is to get a process for bootstrapping the Raspberry Pi Zeros.\nInstall the official Raspberry Pi Imager \u0026hellip;from https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/.\n(You could use this zsh script I wrote to do that, but honestly it seems like a lot of trouble to go to.)\nIMAGER=\u0026#34;/Applications/Raspberry Pi Imager.app\u0026#34; # Install RPi imager software if it\u0026#39;s not already available if [[ ! -a $IMAGER ]]; then IMAGER_DOWNLOAD=\u0026#34;https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_1.5.dmg\u0026#34; wget $IMAGER_DOWNLOAD DISKIMAGE=$(hdiutil attach ./imager_1.5.dmg | grep \u0026#39;Raspberry\u0026#39; | cut -f1) cp -R \u0026#34;/Volumes/Raspberry Pi Imager/Raspberry Pi Imager.app\u0026#34; /Applications/ hdiutil detach $DISKIMAGE fi Transfer the OS image to the microSD card  Open Raspberry Pi Imager Plug in microSD card Choose Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) Choose microSD card CHoose Write MacOS is likely to ask you for various permissions for the imager The imaging unmounts the SD card, so unplug it and plug it in again  Prepare the OS image for first boot The first boot will be headless (no keyboard/monitor) and wireless (i.e. I want it to connect to my Wifi with no further configuration nesessary).

Don\u0026#39;t actually write html like this - it is a silly idea. \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): return \u0026#34;\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;\u0026#34; + func(*args, **kwargs) + \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\u0026#34; return wrapper # Use the decorator here, before the function definition. @heading1 def subject(): return \u0026#34;Decorators: A neat way to modify functions\u0026#34; print subject() # Output is \u0026#34;\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Decorators: A neat way to modify functions\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\u0026#34; That seems very neat, but this is a simple way of writing something complicated, so there are some kinks to iron out. The first is that in a generally applicable decorator, the decorating function must be able to accept an arbitrary argument list (meaning any arrangement of arguments and keyword arguments). The issue with this is that the resulting decorated function takes on the signature of the decorating function, so introspection of the function tells you that it accepts all positional and keyword arguments (*args, **kwargs).\nThe second problem is that the decorating function does not have the same attributes as the decorated function. E.g. __name__, __doc__, __module__, __dict__ and in Python 3, __annotations__.\nThe solution to these problems is provided in the form of the decorator package. This does all the leg-work of copying attributes as well as making signature-preserving decorators. As an added bonus, it removes the need to nest the wrapper function.\nHere is the same trivial example, written using the decorator module:\nimport decorator @decorator.decorator def heading1(func, *args, **kwargs): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;This was the wrapper function for the decorator. It now takes the caller function as the first argument. The defining of the decorator itself is handled by... the decorator! \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; return \u0026#34;\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;\u0026#34; + func(*args, **kwargs) + \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\u0026#34; # Use the decorator here, before the function definition. @heading1 def subject(): return \u0026#34;Decorators: A neat way to modify functions\u0026#34; print subject() # Output is \u0026#34;\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Decorators: A neat way to modify functions\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\u0026#34; There are plenty more resources for managing and learning about decorators. If you want to avoid installing the decorators package, you can do some of the hard work with functools.wraps. There\u0026rsquo;s more about the decorators package and some good examples in the package documentation. StackOverflow is always a good place to look for examples (good and bad). The Python docs have a page full of decorator examples.\nThanks to saurik over on Hacker News for pointing out that I should really be using decorator.decorator as a decorator.\n","permalink":"https://blog.kember.net/posts/2012-04-decorators-a-neat-way-to-modify-functions/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn Python, decorators are a construction that help reduce boilerplate code, enhance the maintainability of our code and address the separation of concerns.

One of the first things we needed to rule out was dodgy water in her bottles.\nTo make up the bottles, we boil freshly drawn water in our kettle. We leave it to cool for about half an hour (boiling water in plastic bottles can apparently release more Bisphenol A) before pouring it into freshly sterilised bottles, which are then sealed.\nI remember advice for campers indicating that water should be boiled for some time to kill pathogens. Whilst our kettle boils the water thoroughly, it only maintains a rolling boil for a few seconds. The question is, does this kill the nasty microbes?\nAccording to Survival Topics and The Backpacker\u0026rsquo;s Field Manual by Rick Curtis\n \u0026ldquo;Boiling is the most certain way of killing all micro-organisms. According to the Wilderness Medical Society, water temperatures above 160°F (70°C) kill all pathogens within 30 minutes and above 185°F (85°C) within a few minutes.

I’m not even using the environment-set proxy – I’m defining my own, thus:\nproxy_handler = urllib2.ProxyHandler({\u0026#39;http\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;http://myproxy.net:3128\u0026#39;}) opener = urllib2.build_opener() opener.add_handler(proxy_handler) Solution 2 Ah! But urllib2.build_opener() has a set of default handlers, one of which is a proxy handler. Guess what the default behaviour of the proxy handler is, when you don’t give it a proxy url? It gets it from the environment.\nSo you’re ending up with two proxy handlers. The default one gleaned from the environment, and your custom one. It seems that it only uses the custom one (try it using Wireshark) but it still processes the environment one. So if the format of the environment one is wrong, it breaks your script. This is a bit unpredictable and brittle, so try this instead:\nproxy_handler = urllib2.ProxyHandler({\u0026#39;http\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;http://myproxy.net:3128\u0026#39;}) opener = urllib2.build_opener(proxy_handler) That will give you one and only one proxy handler.\n[Updated 03/03/2008 to add] To get no proxies – i.e. to disable proxies, do this:\nproxy_support = urllib2.ProxyHandler({}) opener = urllib2.build_opener(proxy_support) urllib2.install_opener(opener) # Optional - makes this opener default for urlopen etc. Solution to end all solutions I tried this on Python 2.5 and it exhibited none of these problems. I’ve looked at the new urllib2 code which has much more detailed and careful proxy url parsing, allowing a more liberal approach to defining proxies.\n[Updated 09/03/2010 to add] Ciprian Trofin has emailed me to point out that while the parsing of proxy urls in environment variables improved in Python 2.5, the build_opener still uses default handlers, and gets its proxy from the environment, when none is specified. This is the case with Python 2.6 – I guess it’s an awkward feature, not actually a bug. Thanks to Ciprian for the update and clarification!\n  Okay – we’re done.

However, despite plenty of effort from the government, among others, stop-smoking campaigns are not working. We are creatures of habit, and while we dislike change, we are even more hostile to change that’s imposed upon us. This may be borne out by research that shows that approximately 40%-60% of patients with a smoking-related disease still smoke after being told they have a chronic disease. (1)\nIf nicotine is harmful, then this would make it a candidate for proscription. In concentrated form, nicotine is used as an insecticide. It affects the autonomic nervous system and, in small doses, causes the heart rate to rise, causes blood vessels to constrict and increases the feeling of alertness (2). Nicotine is physiologically addictive. An overdose (i.e. smoking while using nicotine patches or an inhaler) can cause nausea and palpitations. Long term use of nicotine replacements like inhalers and patches may cause cell damage in blood vessels and lungs. Clearly, addiction to nicotine can in itself be harmful.\nFrom the evidence I’ve seen, I think that nicotine replacement therapy is the least-worst option for smokers. Patches and inhalers (3) offer significantly reduced health risks compared to smoking, and allow nicotine dependence to be reduced gradually, which is a more effective method of quitting than stopping immediately (cold turkey) but offers health benefits over ramping down cigarette use. (4)\nIn the end, the effectiveness of any method of quitting must be linked to the determination of the smoker to quit, but encouraging these supportive medicines and technologies must be a Good Thing.\nAlso: Beyond ‘Smoking Kills’\n","permalink":"https://blog.kember.net/posts/2005-08-no-smoke-without-cigarettes/","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Which aspect of cigarette smoking is bad?\u0026rdquo; Is it the addiction to nicotine, or is it the harmful chemicals that go along with that?","title":"No smoke without... cigarettes?"},{"content":"I shall be getting baptised this Sunday.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been a Christian for many years, but haven\u0026rsquo;t yet done this.

Sir Harry Hands, the Mayor of Cape Town, ordered a two-minute silent pause, to follow the firing of the Noon gun, in commemoration of those lost. (Source: Wikipedia)\n In this country, King George V requested a silence to be observed on the anniversary of the inception of the armistice, the cessation of hostilities as a prelude to peace negotiations between the Allies and Germany. He said, “All locomotion should cease, so that, in perfect stillness, the thoughts of everyone may be concentrated on reverent remembrance of the glorious dead.”\nI don’t think that I am dishonouring those killed in the recent catastrophe by drawing a distinction between the tsunami and the wars in which so many died.
