I&amp;rsquo;ve trained Gmail to put important messages in the Inbox, but Promotions and Updates are streams of ephemeral information that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to maintain. I glance at new messages there, and read what I want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m writing a Google Apps Script to regularly archive those email streams.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pancakes (American-style)</title><link>https://dev.kem.li/posts/2021-03-pancakes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dev.kem.li/posts/2021-03-pancakes/</guid><description>My wife, who&amp;rsquo;s an accomplished cook and baker, scribbled out a simple recipe to help me make pancakes.
I took that simple instruction and had fun turning it into this monster.

Why? I like comfort and efficiency. If I know the temperature of each room in my house, with periodic measurements twenty four hours a day, I can tune the heating system to be comfortable and energy efficient. Because I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a geek, this is classed as &amp;lsquo;fun&amp;rsquo; which means I don&amp;rsquo;t need to offset the cost of the project against my heating bill.</description></item><item><title>Commonplace book</title><link>https://dev.kem.li/posts/2021-03-commonplace/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dev.kem.li/posts/2021-03-commonplace/</guid><description>A commonplace book is a scrapbook of wisdom.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been hunting around for this concept for a while. Journals are about past events and reflection. I have Day One and a pad of paper for that. Notes are for collections of mundane knowledge: What plants are called in the garden, a list of CO2 monitors I might choose, the shortcut for resetting the SMC on a MacBook. I have Bear and OneNote for that.</description></item><item><title>Autonomy, mastery, purpose</title><link>https://dev.kem.li/posts/2021-03-autonomy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dev.kem.li/posts/2021-03-autonomy/</guid><description>Motivating people - allowing team members' intrinsic motivation to flourish - is about granting them autonomy, encouraging them to develop mastery, and convincing them of our purpose.
One more step: Getting enough feedback to know how to set them up to succeed.
This is hard.</description></item><item><title>dev.
