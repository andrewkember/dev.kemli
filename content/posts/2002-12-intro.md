Welcome to Kember.net. The site has shrunk since its redecoration. I'm striving for concinnity over kilobytes.<!--more--> There will be more in time, but I have more pressing matters to attend to: Washing my hair - strand at a time. Re-arranging my CDs in colour order, listening to strange and wonderful tales of people putting freeze-dried coffee in the microwave. No, really. Browse at will.

Andrew.
