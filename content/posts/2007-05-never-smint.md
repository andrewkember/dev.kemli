I've just been reading about [Xylitol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylitol), the sweetener used in [Smint](http://www.smint.com/), [Orbit Complete](http://www.wrigley.co.uk/index.cfm?articleid=136) and lots of other sweets and chewing gums. <!--more-->It's a bit like the aspirin of the mint-world. It helps re-mineralise teeth, improves bone-density in osteoporosis sufferers and helps prevent ear infections. It has no known side-effects, other than a mild laxative effect at high doses. Unless you're a dog. Even small doses can cause [hypoglyc&aelig;mia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia) (low blood sugar levels) in dogs, which can be fatal.

[Charlie](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4690146.stm) says, "Don't play with matches and keep your Smints off the floor."

[Updated to add: Paracetamol is equally dangerous to [cats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Effects_on_animals). In case you were interested.]
