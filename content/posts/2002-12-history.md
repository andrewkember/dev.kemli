In the shower: Dire Straits

> I go checking out the reports  
  Digging up the dirt  
  You get to meet all sorts  
  In this line of work.  <!--more-->
  Treachery and treason  
  There's always an excuse for it  
  And when I find the reason  
  I still can't get used to it.

In the car: Dido

> See my eyes, they carry your reflection,  
  Watch my lips and hear the words I'm telling you.  
  Give your trust to me and look into my heart  
  And show me, show me what you're doing.  
  So sit on top of the world and tell me how you're feeling,  
  What you feel is what I feel for you.

At work: Massive Attack

> Now I can't change the way you think  
  But I can put my arms around you.  
  That's just part of the deal  
  That's the way I feel  
  I put my arms around you.  
>
> I stand in front of you,  
  Take the force of the blow  
  Protection

On the way to the airport: Ocean Colour Scene

> And if I could hold you where would you belong?  
  Sitting here to reason how the world's gone wrong  
  And if I could listen to half the words you say  
  Would your pathway glisten and help you on your way?
