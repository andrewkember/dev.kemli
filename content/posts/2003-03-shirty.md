  I decided to leave the house today to get some much needed leg-stretching by walking into town to buy a shirt. I&#8217;m glad I did, because I bumped into Matt and Caroline, who I haven&#8217;t seen for weeks, and I promised to go pub-quizing with them on Tuesday.

I decided to leave the house today to get some much needed leg-stretching by walking into town to buy a shirt. I&#8217;m glad I did, because I bumped into Matt and Caroline, who I haven&#8217;t seen for weeks, and I promised to go pub-quizing with them on Tuesday.

I will actually go.

I know my reputation for slacking off the pub quiz is such that the team name is often a shocking reference to my washing-up habits, or similar, but I&#8217;m going to go. I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s important, because I get to see my friends, which is more than I do at the moment. I may be able to answer a question as well. Just one &#8211; let&#8217;s not go overboard here.

After my rendez-vous, I called in on some of the clothes shops on Park Street. You know when you look into a clothes shop, and can&#8217;t tell whether the clothes are for men or women? (Work with me here) Well, I managed to avoid the humiliation of asking to try on women&#8217;s clothing (a habit I reserve for special occasions ;-) ) and picked the correct sections of the shops to browse. I found a nice Armani shirt for &#163;105, but decided that my skin tones needed a cheaper shirt. Any cheaper shirt.

Came back shirtless, bought cookies. (Shared them.)
