How I set up my Todo System.

For decades I’ve kept lists of tasks I should do. I weigh my todo list rather than read it. Every few years, I flip-flop between designing complex systems for managing my actions and dumping everything in an increasingly intractable bucket of things-not-done.

For the first time, I’ve found a system that carves out a middle ground that works. For me. I hope you find it interesting.

## Principles

1. **I'm lazy**. I will let any system slide from time to time. The more effort I have to put in, the sooner it'll slide. Adding three or four types of tags to classify a task won't happen.
2. **Completionism is broken at this scale**. I've ticked off over thirteen thousand tasks. I have 84 tasks on my work list (well-pruned). Any system that relies on limiting the total number of tasks won't wash.
3. **Urgency and importance change**. I need to reflect that quickly in my todo system. Maintaining a fully sorted and prioritised backlog of tasks is unrealistic.
4. **Tasks don't expire with age**. Many remain worth doing months after I put them on the list. Systems where old items age out or get lost in the mist won't work. Irrelevant tasks need to be intentionally deleted.
5. **Regular review... isn't**. "Every week, set aside time to review all your actions and tasks." LOL. This is a worthwhile and productive habit. Nevertheless, I don't do it. I need a system that runs satisfactorily without review. Occasional maintenance will keep it trim.

## Why

A brief tour of systems that don't work for me and the chief reason.

**Calendar based systems**: The idea is that you can use calendar events for tasks. The upside is that you schedule your time, and limit the number of things you plan to attempt.

The downside is that my calendar looks like this...

![My calendar on a typical week](/static/posts/2022-12-todo-my-calendar-typical-week.png)

... Before I try to add extra work to it. As tasks roll over from day to day, the system fractures under the load.

**Multiple projects - Kanban-style**: Create separate contexts for separate projects and track tasks through a pipeline from input to done. The hardest part of this approach is that there's but one of me. I need a way of prioritising across these different streams.

**GTD Full Throttle**: I've cribbed liberally from the Getting Things Done methodology, but parts of the organising protocols exhaust me. Classifying tasks by project and context, manually selecting next actions - it's too much. [The Todoist blog has a good treatment of GTD if you want to learn more](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done).

## What

Here's a tour of my Todoist account. I've used Todoist for years, but that hasn't stopped me migrating my tasks to other tools at various points. I've returned to Todoist because it works flawlessly on all the platforms I use (iPhone, iPad, Mac and web) and provides all but one of the features I want. (That one feature, if you're curious, is "task start date" and the only task manager that implements it is Omnifocus.)

If you'd like a list of the best task managers to try (or buy), here it is:

* [Todoist](https://todoist.com) (all platforms)
* [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) (Apple platforms + web)
* [Reminders](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/reminders/id1108187841) (Apple platforms)
* [Asana](https://asana.com) (all platforms)
* [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) (Apple platforms)

There are many others. Use whichever fits your needs.

## How - a tour of my task manager setup

**Separate work and home**:

![Work and Home top level projects](/static/posts/2022-12-todo-work-home.png)

It's the most natural division. Home and work tasks are done at different times - clearly delineated by my office hours. They're grouped in different ways too, for example my home tasks have a list of birthday present ideas that would be out of place in my work projects. I make Work and Home separate top-level projects.

**Context up front - project or service name**:

I try to front-load the task name with as much context as possible. This helps me when I review tasks. It means I can skip through many task names quickly without having to read all the way to the end to know where they fit in.

Good examples:

* Subcontractor onboarding: Add Alice and Bob to Slack.
* Ways of Working: Add pipeline alerting to Definition of Done checklist.

Bad example:

* Need to add 'access to customer prod system' to support customer integrations when we onboard new engineers.

An improvement might have been:

* Engineer onboarding checklist addition: Request access to customer prod system (to support customer integrations).


* Delegate list
* In-flight section
* Waiting on
* Separating clear-and-present todos from whatever/whenever ideas reduces the mental hoops I need to jump through to review tasks and choose my next one. I find reviewing my full list uses a lot of decision-making energy, which is a finite resource ([decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue)).
* Rote
* Templates
* Filters: Prioritised
