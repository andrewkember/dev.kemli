The wonderful news of the last few weeks is that Lisa and I have got engaged! I proposed on Saturday, 22nd March, and Lisa said yes about 1.2 seconds later, which makes me a very happy man.

So you can see why I've been rather busy, these last four weeks.

Never a man to do anything in a hurry, I've been surprised at just how quickly everything has fallen into place, now I've met the Right Girl.
