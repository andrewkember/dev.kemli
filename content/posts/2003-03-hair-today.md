I have the tune to &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; in my head today. So far, it&#8217;s not a problem, but I would like to replace it with something that doesn&#8217;t repeat quite so often. Jingle Bells perhaps.<!--more-->

The Housemate-of-the-Kitchen has threatened to defrost our freezer. I believe that he might just be crazy enough to do it. I wonder what we&#8217;ll find. It&#8217;s like grubbing around under sofa cushions, only the lost, forgotten detritus is fully preserved in its own permafrost.

Getting ready for the Big Hair Do Red Nose Day. I think they had me in mind when they named this one.
