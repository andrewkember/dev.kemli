There are some really long-winded ways of creating a self-signed SSL certificate for [Apache][1] out there on the Intarweb. Most I don't understand well enough to implement, and the few that were simple enough to implement didn't work.<!--more-->

I'm not sure that this is worth shouting from the rooftops, but I'll stand at a fairly high window and say,
