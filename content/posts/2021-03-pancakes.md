I took that simple instruction and had fun turning it into this monster.

# Ingredients

This makes four or five small pancakes.

* 1 cup self raising flour
* 1.5 tblsp sugar
* 1 egg
* 125ml milk
* 1 tsp baking powder
* ~~0.5 tsp citric acid (optional)~~
* 30ml (approx) hot water

# Equipment

* Large mixing bowl
* Measuring jug
* Small bowl
* Large frying pan
* Vegetable oil
* Whisk
* Spatula (turner)
* Ladle
* Oil brush
* Cooling rack
* Measures:
	* 1 cup (237ml)
	* 1 tblsp
	* 1 tsp
	* 0.5 tsp

# Instructions

* Boil the kettle.
* Put the frying pan on a medium heat. 
* Add some vegetable oil to the pan.

<br>

* In the large mixing bowl, mix flour and baking powder.
* In the measuring jug, whisk together the egg and the milk.
* In the small bowl, mix the hot water, sugar and citric acid until dissolved.

<br>

* Pour the egg and milk into the large mixing bowl.
* Combine them with the flour and baking powder.
* Do not over-mix.

<br>

* Add the water, sugar and citric acid mix to the large mixing bowl and combine. 
* Consistency should be like thick double cream.
* Do not over mix.

## Cooking stage

* Use the oil brush to distribute the oil evenly in the pan.
* Pour one ladle-full of mixture into the centre of the pan.
* Flip the pancake using the spatula as soon as the bottom is solid. (This prevents the bubbles escaping from the top and makes the pancakes nice and puffy.)

<br>

* Cook until light brown.
* Flip if needed to finish off the first side.
* Place on the cooling rack.
* Add more oil to the pan if needed.

Repeat cooking stage until large mixing bowl is empty ðŸ˜‹
