I took that simple instruction and had fun turning it into this monster.

## Ingredients

This makes four or five small pancakes.

* 1 cup self raising flour
* 2 tblsp sugar
* 1 egg
* 220ml milk
* 1 tsp baking powder

## Equipment

* Large mixing bowl
* Measuring jug
* Large frying pan
* Vegetable oil
* Whisk
* Spatula (turner)
* Ladle
* Oil brush
* Cooling rack
* Measures:
	* 1 cup (237ml)
	* 1 tblsp
	* 1 tsp

## Instructions

* In the large mixing bowl, mix flour, sugar and baking powder.
* In the measuring jug, whisk together the egg and the milk.

<!-- Make separate lists work-->

* Pour the egg and milk into the large mixing bowl.
* Combine them with the flour, sugar and baking powder.
* Do not over-mix.
* Consistency should be like thick double cream.

<!-- Make separate lists work-->

* Put the bowl into the fridge for 20 mins (min) or overnight (max).

## Cooking stage

* Put the frying pan on a medium heat.
* Add some vegetable oil to the pan.

<!-- Make separate lists work-->

* Use the oil brush to distribute the oil evenly in the pan.
* Pour one ladle-full of mixture into the centre of the pan.
* Flip the pancake using the spatula as soon as the bottom is solid. (This prevents the bubbles escaping from the top and makes the pancakes nice and puffy.)

<!-- Make separate lists work-->

* Cook until light brown.
* Flip if needed to finish off the first side.
* Place on the cooling rack.
* Add more oil to the pan if needed.

Repeat cooking stage until large mixing bowl is empty ðŸ˜‹
