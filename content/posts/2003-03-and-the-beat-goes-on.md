Back from Greece, had a great time despite the British weather. The hotel was excellent – so glad we stayed in a posh hotel rather than a cheaper one, it was good to have a refreshing break from the hustle and bustle of Athenian pedestrian traffic, in air-conditioned luxury. Photos in progress – might put some of them up here if I feel so inclined.

Got rather a reputation after playing Scrabble in public places. Still, my game is much improved – those triple-word-scores hold no fear for me now.
