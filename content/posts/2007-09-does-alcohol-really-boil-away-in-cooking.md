Heard that before? It's the accepted wisdom about hot food made with alcoholic drinks. However, all is not as it seems &mdash; the accepted wisdom is *wrong*.

In [this][1] article, it's explained that baking or simmering for 15 minutes leaves 40% of the alcohol. 1 hour of cooking leaves 25% of the alcohol.

The raw taste of the alcohol very quickly fades when the food is heated, but a large amount of alcohol remains.
