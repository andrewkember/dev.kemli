A commonplace book is a scrapbook of wisdom.

I've been hunting around for this concept for a while. Journals are about past events and reflection. I have [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) and a [pad of paper](https://rhodiapads.com/collections_dot_top_wirebound.php) for that. Notes are for collections of mundane knowledge: What plants are called in the garden, a list of CO2 monitors I might choose, the shortcut for resetting the SMC on a MacBook. I have [Bear](https://bear.app) and [OneNote](http://onenote.com/) for that. 

But what should I use to remind myself of nuggets of wisdom I find in books, or discover through experience? A commonplace book. First I found out about household manuals, and thought I had pinpointed my idea, but it didn't take long to realise they were all about running a house staff team, which is a long way from what I need. Yesterday I came across [Ryan Holiday's article about keeping a commonplace book](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/) and realised: This is it.
