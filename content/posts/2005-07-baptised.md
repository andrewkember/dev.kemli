I shall be getting baptised this Sunday.<!--more--> I've been a Christian for many years, but haven't yet done this. It's an opportunity to demonstrate my faith and the way that God has made me right with Him. The symbol of washing away my sins, leaving me clean and unblemished is a powerful one. Baptism is also clearly necessary. Jesus is baptised, and we are told to be baptised too.
