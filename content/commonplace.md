## Introduction

A commonplace book is a collection of wisdom - things learned through experience. This collection is primarily for my own benefit, and is probably less wise than I realise.

## Testing

This section is for tentative wisdom.

* To clean out a junk drawer, remove the contents and put it in a box. Only when you've used one of the items in the box twice is it allowed to live in the drawer again. After a month, pitch or donate the remaining contents—or move the precious or useful stuff to deeper storage. But, yeah, you should probably just pitch it. (Merlin)
* Chesterton's Fence (Merlin)


## Internal

* Photos of people make better memories than photos of places.
* If you're feeling gloomy inexplicably, drink a large glass of water. Sometimes, it's just dehydration.

## External

* Keep moving and get out of the way. (Thanks, John)
* Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by ignorance. Ignorance is more likely to be unwitting error than stupidity. But sometimes people are dicks. Don't be a dick.
* Compliment children on something they can see too. "I like your unicorn boots."
* Related: Works for adults too.
* When somebody says something that makes you angry, don't respond immediately, but do respond. Unless it's on the internet.
* Always be kind:

> Here’s the thing about being Kind, versus being Nice,” I said. “I have interacted with lots of nice people who are incredibly unkind. Why is that? How do you choose to be nice but not kind?”
>
> I pointed to my head. “This is where nice comes from,” I said. Then, I put my hand over my heart. “This is where kind comes from.”

### Responsibilities and boundaries

* Poor planning on your part does not necessitate an emergency on mine. (Thanks, Titus)
* Not my circus, not my monkeys (i.e. It's none of my business)
* Unless: It's not my fault but it is my problem.

## Things

* Two is one and one is none. (Thanks, CGP Grey)

## Miscellaneous

* Sometimes rules and deadlines are negotiable. To find out which ones, ask.
