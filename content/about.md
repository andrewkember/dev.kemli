I'm Andrew Kember.

I love helping people with technology, so I do that for a third of my life. I spend another third dreaming about technology, and a tenth raising the next generation of technophiles. I do tend to get fixated on life's ephemera, and I've learnt to work through these preoccupations as quickly and quietly as possible. That said, feel free to chat about hats, shoes, pool cues, watches, denim, cyberpunk, whisky, tea or archery. I think I'm going to be mildly eccentric when I get older, so I'm getting some practice in now.

I'm a Christian who believes that the Bible is the [inspired word of God](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203:16;&amp;version=31;) (2 Timothy 3:16). I love listening to inspiring and convicting sermons by [Ross Brown](http://ibcfife.org/sermons_current.html), [John Piper](http://www.desiringgod.org/) and [Matt Chandler](http://www.thevillagechurch.net/). <!-- (Preach-tastic:) I can't do anything to deserve God's grace, so I'm taking His freely offered gift in the sincere hope that Jesus has died to pay the penalty for my sinfulness and beaten death: Resurrected, renewed and alive forever in a perfect relationship with God. He said I can have that too, and so can you. -->

I love spending time with my daughters, playing games, reading with them and teaching them silly dance moves (or just making them laugh). I love doting on my wife: Supplying her with caffeine, helping with her projects and unwinding with her in the evenings.

I'm a bit of a geek, who thinks that clear, simple design is lovely. I like eating tasty food, drinking good wine, watching entertaining films and reading absorbing books. I don't eat black pudding and I dislike liver and blue cheese. I enjoy reading my Bible and books by people who know the Bible better than me. I like sci-fi and crime thrillers. I listen to Snow Patrol and U2, some quirky bands like [Tankus the Henge](http://tankusthehenge.co.uk/) and [Jonathan Coulton](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/).
