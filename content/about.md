I'm Andrew Kember.

I live in Scotland with my wife and our daughters. At work I manage an amazing team of cloud software engineers. I'm pretty stoked about cloud technology and automation. I relax around sci-fi, DIY and puzzles - not jigsaws, more like locksport, mechanical watches, Raspberry Pi's and electronics projects.
